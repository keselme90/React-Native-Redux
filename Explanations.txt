connect() - This function allows the componnect to the store and update the state. This function takes two argments:

    - mapStateToProps
    - mapDispatchToProps

        To use the connect function in the component we need to import it from 'react-redux' library:

            import {connect} from 'react-redux'

        Then, when we are exporting the component we will connect it to the store as such:

            export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)

mapStateToProps() - is used when we want to show the data in the component. We will create a function that returns an object.
                    The function takes one argument and it's the state.
                    We pass the state into the function so that later we can grab the data we need for the specific component.

    const mapStateToProps = state => ({
            data: state.data
    })

                    If we want to use that data, we need to pass it as props to our component:

    const MyComponent = (props) => {
        return (
            <Text> props.data </Text>
        )
    }
